This program prints each month for a given year, accounting for different starting days and leap years.

In order to run this program, compile using gcc (gcc -Wall calendar.c) and then run the output file
(./a.out or ./a.exe depending on system)
The program will prompt in the terminal for an input, and expects a 4 didget number from 2020 to 2030
This will decide the year for the printed calendar.
After submitting the input with the enter key, the twelve months in that year will be printed.
The calendar will start and end with the correct start date for that month.
This accounts for leap years in 2020, 2024, and 2028.
Inputting an invalid year will provide an error message and will ask you to submit a different year
