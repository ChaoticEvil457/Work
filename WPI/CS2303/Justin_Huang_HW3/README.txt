This program adds, subtracts, or multiplies two matricies.

In order to run this program, run make matrixCalc and run the matrix_calc.o file.
The program will prompt in the terminal for two inputs for matrix A and expects 2 integers
It will then prompt for floats a number of times equal to the product of those first two integers
Afterwards this will repeat for matrix B
The program will then prompt a character response of a, s or m standing for add, subtract, or multiply
Afterwards it will print out 

A (+,-,or *) B = 
    num1 num2
    num3 num4

changing depending on sizes of matricies

Invalid inputs will return an error statement.

I didn't have any problems with this program, I completed it Friday between classes
