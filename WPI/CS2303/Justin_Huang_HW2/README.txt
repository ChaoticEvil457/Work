This program prints each month for a given year, accounting for different starting days and leap years.

In order to run this program, compile using gcc (gcc -Wall calendar.c) and then run the output file
(./a.out or ./a.exe depending on system)
The program will prompt in the terminal for an input, and expects an integer.
This will decide the year for the printed calendar.
After submitting the input with the enter key, the twelve months in that year will be printed.
The calendar will start and end with the correct start date for that month. 
Ex: if January ends on Friday, Febuary will start on Saturday
This accounts for leap years.

I didn't have any problems with this program, I completed it Thursday between classes
